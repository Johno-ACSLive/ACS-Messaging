## Roadmap

That doesn't mean the library is done, still a lot of work to do and I have the following in mind currently:
- Convert this project over to .NET Core / Standard
- Refactoring based on new framework capability
- Add message framing
- Add chunked transfers
- Add serialisation (maybe or can be optional)
- Standardise on naming conventions (varies slightly)
- Add CI/CD pipelines and build status to README
- Publish NuGet packages
- Add documentation / samples
